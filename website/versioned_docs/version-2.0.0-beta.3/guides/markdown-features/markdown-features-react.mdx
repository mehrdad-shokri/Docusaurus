## Using JSX in Markdown {#using-jsx-in-markdown}

Docusaurus has built-in support for [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which allows you to write JSX within your Markdown files and render them as React components.

:::note

While both `.md` and `.mdx` files are parsed using MDX, some of the syntax are treated slightly differently. For the most accurate parsing and better editor support, we recommend using the `.mdx` extension for files containing MDX syntax.

:::

Try this block here:

```jsx
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!
```

Notice how it renders both the markup from your React component and the Markdown syntax:

```mdx-code-block
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<BrowserWindow minHeight={240} url="http://localhost:3000">

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight>
{` `}and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!

</BrowserWindow>
```

<br />

You can also import your own components defined in other files or third-party components installed via npm! Check out the [MDX docs](https://mdxjs.com/) to see what other fancy stuff you can do with MDX.

:::caution

Since all doc files are parsed using MDX, any HTML is treated as JSX. Therefore, if you need to inline-style a component, follow JSX flavor and provide style objects. This behavior is different from Docusaurus 1. See also [Migrating from v1 to v2](../../migration/migration-manual.md#convert-style-attributes-to-style-objects-in-mdx).

## Importing code snippets {#importing-code-snippets}

You can not only import a file containing a component definition, but also import any code file as raw text, and then insert it in a code block, thanks to [Webpack raw-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/raw-loader/).

```jsx title="myMarkdownFile.mdx"
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource from '!!raw-loader!./myComponent';

<CodeBlock className="language-jsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>;
```

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/pages/examples/_myComponent';

<BrowserWindow url="http://localhost:3000">

<CodeBlock className="language-jsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>

</BrowserWindow>

<br />
```

:::note

You have to use `<CodeBlock>` rather than the Markdown triple-backtick ` ``` `, because the latter will ship out any of its content as-is, but you want JSX to insert the imported text here.

:::

:::warning

This feature is experimental and might be subject to API breaking changes in the future.

## Importing Markdown {#importing-markdown}

You can use Markdown files as components and import them elsewhere, either in Markdown files or in React pages. Below we are importing from [another file](./markdown-features-intro.mdx) and inserting it as a component.

```jsx
import Intro from './markdown-features-intro.mdx';

<Intro />;
```

```mdx-code-block
import Intro from './markdown-features-intro.mdx';

<BrowserWindow url="http://localhost:3000">

<Intro />

</BrowserWindow>

<br />
```

This way, you can reuse contents among multiple pages and avoid duplicating materials.

:::caution

The table-of-contents does not currently contain the imported Markdown headings. This is a technical limitation that we are trying to solve ([issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3915)).
