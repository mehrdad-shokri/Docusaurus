# new.docusaurus.io

This is a Netlify deployment that only redirects to the official CodeSandbox template.

https://codesandbox.io/s/github/facebook/docusaurus/tree/master/examples/classic

The Netlify deployment (Joel can give access): https://app.netlify.com/sites/docusaurus-new/overview

Builds are stopped because we shouldn't need to redeploy the \_redirects file. You can just trigger a manual build if needed.
